# Section 5 â€“ Refactoring Code Smells in Practice

This activity is designed to help you practice identifying code smells and applying refactoring patterns to a real codebase in CMPM 121, Game Development Patterns.

Code Smells:
Mysterious Name - renamed variables
Inconsistent Code - stored all html ids as variables instead of doing half variables half hard-coded
Remove Dead Code - removed unnecessary start function and called setup directly instead
Duplicate Code - extract function (updateDisplay for event listeners)
Global Variable - encapsulate variable (extracted counter into its own class)
